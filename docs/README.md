# Documentation

To make the analysis and selection process more transparent, we documented both the [list of service-based maintainability metrics](metrics/README.md) and the [list of tracing/monitoring tools](tools/README.md). Furthermore, we published the [results of the tool demonstration](demonstration-results) with an example system (<https://github.com/senecajs/ramanujan>).
